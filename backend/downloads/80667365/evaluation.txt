This vehicle may not be the best candidate for flipping given the substantial rear-end damage and the cost of necessary repairs. While the front and interior are generally intact, the rear bodywork repairs could exceed the resale profit margin unless the vehicle is obtained at a very low purchase price. Proceed cautiously based on repair costs and purchase price.
