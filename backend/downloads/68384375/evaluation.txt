This vehicle shows significant front-end damage but the rest of the body and interior are in decent condition. Given the apparent engine brand and type, resale value could be promising if repairs are not excessively costly. However, given the visible damage, it might not be a straightforward flip and could involve substantial upfront investment to bring it to a roadworthy state. Suitable for experienced investors comfortable with moderate to high-risk projects.
