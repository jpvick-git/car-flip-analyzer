This vehicle appears to be a good candidate for flipping. It has minor exterior damage but a clean interior and engine bay, indicating that with minimal investment, it can be made roadworthy and presentable for resale. The make and model, coupled with apparently low maintenance needs, suggest a good resale potential.
