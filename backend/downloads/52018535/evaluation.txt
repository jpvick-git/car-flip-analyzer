This vehicle seems to be in generally decent condition with mainly cosmetic issues, making it a reasonable candidate for flipping. If the mechanical aspects and mileage are verified to be solid, the repair costs are manageable, and the vehicle should be easy to resell at a profit after repairs. Being a fairly current model, it may still attract interest from buyers.
