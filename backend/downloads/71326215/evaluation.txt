This vehicle may not be a good candidate for flipping due to the extensive front-end damage and potential hidden mechanical issues. Repair costs are sizable and may not justify the resale value unless purchased at a significant discount. Consider this vehicle only if parts are easily accessible and labor can be minimized.
