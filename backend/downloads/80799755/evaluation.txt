This car is a reasonable candidate for flipping if purchased at a low price. The visible damage is mostly superficial, involving replaceable parts like bumpers and headlights. Resale potential is good for a popular model like this one, assuming no major mechanical issues are present. However, the cost of repairs versus the potential resale value should be carefully considered.
