This vehicle needs extensive repairs, particularly to the front end and potentially the suspension. While the body damage and interior airbag repair are considerable, the vehicle could be a reasonable flip if the engine and frame are intact and the purchase price is low. The resale potential depends on the market demand for this type of truck and costs involved.
