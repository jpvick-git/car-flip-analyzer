This vehicle is not an ideal candidate for flipping due to extensive front-end damage and airbag deployment. The repair costs are high, and the complexities involved in restoring the structural integrity and mechanical systems could exceed the potential resale value. It would be prudent to consider vehicles with less severe damage for a more profitable flip.
