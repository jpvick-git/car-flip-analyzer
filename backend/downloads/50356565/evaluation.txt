This vehicle might not be an ideal candidate for flipping due to substantial front-end damage that could be costly to repair. The internal condition is good, but the complexity and potential cost of mechanical repairs lower its investment appeal. If repair and purchase costs can be tightly controlled, there may be marginal profit potential.
