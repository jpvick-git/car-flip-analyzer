The truck appears to be in generally good condition with minor cosmetic needs. There is evidence of scratches and small dents on the exterior, which would require a basic paint touch-up and detailing. The interior seems tidy but might benefit from a thorough cleaning. No major mechanical issues are visible, but a standard service check is advised to ensure roadworthiness.
