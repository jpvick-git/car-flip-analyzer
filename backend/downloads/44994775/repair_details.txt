The vehicle has significant front-end damage, including a dislodged front bumper and damage to the front-left fender and hood. The headlights and possibly underlying structural components like the radiator support might also require inspection and repair. Interior airbags appear deployed, which suggests potential electronic or safety system replacements are needed.
