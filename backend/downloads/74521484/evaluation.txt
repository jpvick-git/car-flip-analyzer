This vehicle may be a reasonable candidate for flipping if acquired at a low price. The damage appears to be cosmetic but requires verification of any underlying issues. Considerable parts replacement and labor are expected, but the interior appears intact, offering potential resale appeal if repairs are cost-effective.
