This van could be a decent flip candidate if acquired at a low purchase price. Though it requires some cosmetic and potential mechanical repairs, it appears structurally sound. The cost of repairs is moderate and should be weighed against its possible resale value. A thorough mechanical inspection is recommended to assess any additional repairs before purchase.
