This vehicle could be a reasonable candidate for flipping, provided the purchase price is low. The apparent missing engine component could be an easy fix if not indicative of more extensive issues. The exterior and interior require cleaning and minor cosmetic improvements, which are relatively inexpensive. Overall, the resale potential seems positive if the mechanical condition is sound.
