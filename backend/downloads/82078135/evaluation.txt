This car has potential for flipping due to its intact interior and engine, which suggests lower mechanical repair needs. However, the significant damage to the rear wheel and possibly the suspension can lead to higher repair costs and should be meticulously assessed. If acquired at a low price, it could be a profitable flip after repairs, given the visual appeal and likely demand for this type of vehicle.
