This SUV shows severe front-end damage but the interior is in good condition. Given the extent of the damage, repair costs could be substantial. It may have resale potential if purchased at a very low price, considering the strong demand for SUVs, but the repair complexity makes it a risky candidate for flipping. Thorough cost analysis is recommended before purchase.
