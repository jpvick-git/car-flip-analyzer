This vehicle appears to be a solid candidate for flipping due to its generally good condition. The repairs needed are mostly cosmetic and wonâ€™t require extensive mechanical work based on visible evidence. With moderate investment in cleaning and minor repairs, the car holds good resale potential, given its decent make and relatively presentable interiors.
