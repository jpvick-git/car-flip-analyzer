This vehicle could be a viable candidate for flipping if acquired at a low purchase price. The damage appears mostly cosmetic, concentrated in key body parts that can be replaced or repaired without significant mechanical work. However, high repair costs could impact profit margins. Consider it a moderate risk, only worthwhile with favorable purchasing terms.
