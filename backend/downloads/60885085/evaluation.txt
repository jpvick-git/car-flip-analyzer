This vehicle appears to be a moderately good candidate for flipping if purchased at a low enough price. The visible damage is primarily cosmetic and localized to the front end. However, the complexity of repairs and potential hidden damage could affect profitability. If the engine and undercarriage are intact, this could be a worthwhile investment.
