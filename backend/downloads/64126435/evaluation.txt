This vehicle could be a reasonable purchase for flipping due to its overall body condition and intact engine bay. However, the front-end damage and airbag replacement raise repair costs significantly. If acquired at a low purchase price, it might yield profit post-repair, given the popularity and demand of trucks from this manufacturer. Resale potential is moderate due to visible damage history.
