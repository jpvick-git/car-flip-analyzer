The front end is severely damaged, requiring replacement of the hood, bumper, headlights, and potentially the radiator and other underlying components. The frame might need inspection and potential alignment. Interior seems intact, but airbags might need checking. Paint touch-ups and minor bodywork are needed for scratches and dents visible on the rear side.
