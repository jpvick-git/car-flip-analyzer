This car is a challenging flip candidate due to the extent of body damage and potential hidden engine or frame issues from the collision. While repairs are feasible, they might outweigh the resale value unless the vehicle is a high-demand model. Proceed with caution and evaluate further mechanical aspects before purchase.
