This vehicle shows significant rear-end damage, which may involve complex and costly repairs. While it could be a profitable flip if acquired at a very low initial cost, the extensive repairs required decrease its attractiveness as a flip candidate. If similar models have high resale value and demand in the market, it might be worth considering after obtaining a more precise repair estimate.
