This vehicle appears to have a moderate level of external damage but no visible severe structural or mechanical issues. If the engine and underbody are in good condition, it could be a reasonable candidate for flipping. Repair costs are manageable, but ensure an in-depth inspection to avoid unforeseen expenses. Given its recent manufacture date, it has good resale potential if repaired.
