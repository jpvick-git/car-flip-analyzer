The vehicle shows minor exterior cosmetic damage and a deployed airbag, which are the most visible issues that need addressing. The paint appears slightly worn in areas and the tires require inspection for roadworthiness. The engine bay looks generally clean but a thorough inspection is needed to check for any hidden mechanical issues. Main costs would come from airbag replacement, minor bodywork, potential new tires, and detailed cleaning.
