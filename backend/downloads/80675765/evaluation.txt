This vehicle could be a decent flip candidate if purchased at a low cost given its apparent damage. The repairs focus on bodywork and cosmetic elements, which might be manageable, but potential buyers should be aware of unseen engine or structural issues from the impact. Resale potential is fair if repairs restore full functionality and appearance without excessive cost.
