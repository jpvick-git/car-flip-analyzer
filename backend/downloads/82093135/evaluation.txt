This vehicle seems to be a reasonable candidate for flipping if acquired at a low purchase price. With only moderate cleaning and maintenance needed, the repair complexity is low. Its resale potential is good, especially if the mileage is within a reasonable range, making it likely to attract family buyers looking for a used SUV.
