This vehicle appears to be in generally good condition aside from the rear bumper issue. Assuming the mechanical components are sound, it could be a reasonable flip candidate due to minimal visible damage. Repair costs seem manageable, making it a potential low-risk investment for resale depending on final acquisition cost.
