This vehicle is a potential candidate for flipping if acquired at a low purchase price. The damage is mainly cosmetic with a likely fixed repair cap of around $4500 to make it roadworthy and presentable. Considering the make and market for such vehicles, there is decent resale potential assuming no major mechanical issues are discovered.
