This car may not be an ideal candidate for flipping due to the substantial side damage which can be expensive and time-consuming to repair. While the interior and engine bay appear to be in good condition, the resale value could be impacted by the accident history. Unless acquired at a very low price, the repair costs might not justify the investment.
