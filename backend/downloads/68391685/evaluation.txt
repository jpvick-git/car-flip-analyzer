This vehicle appears to be a decent candidate for flipping due to its overall good body condition and seemingly minor repair needs. The main cost will involve interior refurbishment and cleaning, which should not be overly expensive. Its potential resale value, assuming no significant mechanical issues, could make this a profitable flip.
