This vehicle appears to be a good candidate for flipping due to its relatively clean condition and the luxury badge, which often has strong resale potential. Repair work is primarily cosmetic. If a pre-purchase inspection confirms no major mechanical issues, this car could be flipped for a reasonable profit after minimal investment in cleaning and detailing.
