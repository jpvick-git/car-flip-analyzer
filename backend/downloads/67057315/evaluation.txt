This vehicle presents a substantial challenge for flipping due to the extensive front-end damage and airbag deployment. The repair costs could outweigh the potential resale value, especially without knowing the specific make, model, and mileage. It might be a difficult flip unless acquired at a very low initial cost, with parts available at a discount.
