Visible damage includes a severely damaged rear wheel and suspension, likely requiring replacement of the wheel and potentially rear axle repairs. The body appears intact otherwise, so cosmetic fixes should be minimal. The interior and engine seem to be in good condition, which reduces further repair costs.
