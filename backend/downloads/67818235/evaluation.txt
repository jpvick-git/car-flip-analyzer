This vehicle could be a viable candidate for flipping if acquired at a low purchase price. The visible damage is mainly cosmetic, and the interior is in excellent shape, which is a positive for resale. However, potential buyers should verify that there are no hidden mechanical issues. If repair costs can be controlled, there is potential for profit.
