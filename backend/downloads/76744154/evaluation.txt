This car could be a good candidate for flipping if purchased at a low cost. While the interior and engine appear intact, the front-end damage is significant. If the car was acquired at a bargain price, the repair costs could be kept within a reasonable range for resale. However, ensure mechanical components are assessed thoroughly to avoid unexpected expenses.
