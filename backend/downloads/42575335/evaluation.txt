This car has potential as a flip candidate if acquired at a low price. While the damage is primarily cosmetic, the front-end repairs could be costly. If parts are sourced affordably, the clean interior and general structure suggest good resale potential once repaired, especially if it is determined to run well mechanically after inspection.
