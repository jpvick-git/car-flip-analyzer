This vehicle may not be the best candidate for flipping due to significant visible damage, but if acquired at a low price, it might yield some profit upon repair. The complexity of body repairs and potential hidden mechanical issues could lower resale profits. Consider this purchase only if repair costs are minimized with access to affordable parts and labor.
