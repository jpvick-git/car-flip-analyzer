This SUV may be a decent flip candidate if acquired at a low price, due to substantial front-end damage. Major concerns are the cost of bodywork and checking for hidden structural or engine issues. If the drivetrain is unaffected, and repair costs remain controlled, there could be a reasonable profit margin upon resale.
