This car could be a viable flip candidate if acquired at a low purchase price. While it requires a few notable repairs such as the windshield replacement and possible bodywork, the overall structure seems intact. The estimated repair costs are moderate, and if the car has a clean history and low mileage, it could offer a decent resale profit margin.
