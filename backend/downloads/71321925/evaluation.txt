This vehicle appears to be a reasonable candidate for flipping if acquired at a low purchase price. The main visible issue is the rear bumper, which is manageable in terms of repair. Assuming the absence of significant mechanical faults, this car could resell well due to its make and model popularity, especially with a marketable appearance post-repair.
