The vehicle has significant structural damage to the side and cabin area. The front end appears to have minor damage, but the side impact has compromised the integrity of the cabin, with deployed airbags and internal debris. Repairing this will require extensive bodywork, replacement of the interior components, and ensuring the frame is aligned. A new wheel and tire are also needed.
