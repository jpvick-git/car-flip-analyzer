Visible exterior looks generally good, but some attention may be required for cleaning, minor paint correction, and possible touch-up on rims. Interior appears clean; however, minor detailing and possibly fabric cleaning would enhance its appeal. The engine bay looks intact; standard maintenance checks like oil change and filter replacements are advisable.
