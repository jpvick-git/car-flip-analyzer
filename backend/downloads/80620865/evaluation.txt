This Volkswagen shows serious accident damage. Repair costs are substantial due to front-end damage and airbag deployment. While Volkswagen models can have good resale value, the investment risk is high due to potential hidden damages. Consider this purchase cautiously unless repair costs can be verified as manageable.
