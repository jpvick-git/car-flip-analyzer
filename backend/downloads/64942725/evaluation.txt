This car seems like a decent candidate for flipping. The visible issues are mostly cosmetic and should be relatively inexpensive to fix. With its apparent make and model, it likely has good resale potential, assuming no underlying mechanical issues. It would be wise to verify the mileage and check for any non-visible damages before proceeding.
