The resale value is influenced by the overall condition, assuming the repairs are completed. This mid-sized sedan from Nissan, likely an Altima from around 2015, generally holds respectable market value when cleaned and repaired. The absence of visible major damage or interior tears supports a moderate to high resale value once restored.
