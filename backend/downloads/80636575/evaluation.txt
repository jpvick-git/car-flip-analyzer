This vehicle appears to be a good candidate for flipping. It shows manageable cosmetic damage and the interior is in decent condition, which reduces potential repair costs. The make and model suggest good resale value, assuming the mechanical state is sound. However, verify the engine and transmission conditions to ensure no hidden costs.
