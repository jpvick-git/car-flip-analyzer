This vehicle requires significant front-end repairs, which may be costly and time-consuming. Unless obtained at a low purchase price, the investment may not yield high returns due to repair costs and potential hidden mechanical damages. It might not be an optimal candidate for flipping unless resale value post-repair is considerably high.
