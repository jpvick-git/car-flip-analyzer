This car presents a moderate risk for flipping. While it has noticeable front-end damage, the interior condition is good and repair costs are reasonable if the frame is intact. It could be a viable candidate if purchased at a low initial price, especially if similar models have strong resale values when roadworthy. However, ensure a thorough inspection for hidden mechanical issues.
