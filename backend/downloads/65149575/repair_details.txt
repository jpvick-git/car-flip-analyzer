The front end shows significant damage that likely includes bumper, fender, and possibly suspension repairs. The side panels and rear also exhibit noticeable dents and require body work. The interior appears intact, and the engine bay looks relatively undisturbed but should be checked for hidden damage. Overall, expect extensive body and paintwork and potential mechanical repairs.
