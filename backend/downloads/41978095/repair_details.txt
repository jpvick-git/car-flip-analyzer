The vehicle has visible front-end damage, particularly to the bumper and fender, which will require major repairs or replacement. The interior, especially the back seats, shows signs of heavy wear and dirt, which will need detailing. The engine bay appears dirty but without obvious major issues. Additionally, the rear seems to have some dents and scratches. Repairs should focus on making the car roadworthy and presentable for resale.
