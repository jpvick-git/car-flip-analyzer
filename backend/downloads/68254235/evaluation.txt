This vehicle could be a good flip candidate given its overall condition. The interior is well-maintained, and major damage seems limited to the front exterior, which is more cosmetic than structural. If acquired at a reasonable price, it could be resold profitably after repairs, especially if the year, make, and model are desirable.
