This car is not an ideal candidate for flipping due to extensive rear-end damage which will require costly repairs. While the engine appears in good condition, the high repair cost and complexity involved in restoring structural integrity reduce its profitability. Consideration should be given to the initial purchase price and potential resale value post-repair.
