This vehicle appears to be a good candidate for flipping, as it primarily requires cosmetic and minor part replacement, which tend to be low-cost. The interior and overall structure look sound, which suggests a moderate potential for resale value after repairs. Repair costs are likely manageable relative to the potential resale profit.
