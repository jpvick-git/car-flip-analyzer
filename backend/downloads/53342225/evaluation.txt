This Kia appears to have primarily cosmetic issues, making it a reasonable candidate for flipping. Given the visible condition, repairs are mostly superficial, suggesting a relatively low-cost investment for improvements. If purchased at a favorable price, the vehicle has good resale potential due to its likely recent model year and popular brand.
