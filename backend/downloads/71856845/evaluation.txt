This vehicle is a challenging flip due to substantial front-end damage needing costly repairs. However, if acquired at a low purchase price, and considering it may appeal to sports car enthusiasts, there is potential for profitability after repairs. The engine and interior condition help offset the cost. Ensure a detailed mechanical inspection before proceeding.
