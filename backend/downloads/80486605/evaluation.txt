This car may not be a good candidate for flipping. The extensive front-end damage will likely result in high repair costs, reducing the potential profit margin. Additionally, the unknowns related to possible mechanical issues under the hood add risk. Considering the cost of repairs against potential resale value, it might be better to look for a vehicle with less extensive damage.
