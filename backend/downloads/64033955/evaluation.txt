This car appears to be a viable flip candidate, provided the mechanical condition is sound. The damage is primarily cosmetic, focused on the front end, which is typically not too complex to repair. As the interior is in good shape, and assuming other mechanical components are in working order, it could provide a decent resale profit after necessary repairs.
