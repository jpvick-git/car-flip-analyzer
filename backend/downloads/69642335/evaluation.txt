This vehicle could be a reasonable flip candidate if acquired at a low enough price. The major concern is front-end damage, which may involve expensive repairs. However, if the engine and main components are confirmed intact, the investment could yield a profit, assuming similar models in good condition hold high resale value locally. Consider market competition and repair costs before purchase.
