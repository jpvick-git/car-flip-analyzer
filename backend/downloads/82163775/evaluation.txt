This vehicle could be a good flip candidate if purchased at a low price, assuming no major hidden mechanical issues. The missing wheel and potential driveshaft issue require attention, but the overall condition looks salvageable and the interior is in good shape. Potential resale value is likely high once repairs are completed.
