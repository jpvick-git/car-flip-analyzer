This vehicle shows promise as a flip candidate due to its overall good condition aside from the side damage. The interior is clean, and the engine bay appears well-kept. Assuming no hidden mechanical issues, repairs seem manageable and could yield a profitable resale after relatively modest bodywork investments.
