This vehicle presents a high-risk investment for flipping due to the extensive front-end damage and the deployment of airbags. The repair costs could be high, and potential frame damage might complicate the restoration. Unless sourced at a very low initial cost, or if the vehicle has significant market value when repaired, it may not be a viable option for flipping.
