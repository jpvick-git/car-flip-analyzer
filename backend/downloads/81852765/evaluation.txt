This vehicle has potential for flipping due to its relatively intact exterior and engine appearance. However, the repair complexity is moderate due to the disassembled interior, which might require additional labor and parts. If acquired at a low cost, it could still offer a reasonable profit margin upon resale. Conduct a thorough inspection of mechanical systems for any hidden issues.
