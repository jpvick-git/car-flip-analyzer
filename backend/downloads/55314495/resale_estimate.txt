Assuming the vehicle is a mid-2010s Nissan Altima, post-repair value is contingent on being roadworthy and presentable. Its resale value is influenced by condition and market demand for used vehicles of this type. If repairs are done well, the resale value is good considering its likely age and brand reputation.
