This vehicle may not be a great candidate for flipping due to the extensive front-end damage which could involve costly repairs. While the interior is relatively intact, the potential structural and mechanical issues seen externally suggest a high repair complexity. The overall resale potential may be lower unless acquired at a significantly reduced price.
