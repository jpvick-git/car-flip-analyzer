This vehicle is not a good candidate for flipping. The extensive fire damage means that repair costs would likely far exceed the potential resale value. Additionally, the complexity of repairs required to restore both function and appearance would be prohibitive. Due to the likely structural damage and complete loss of critical systems, demand for resale would be extremely low.
