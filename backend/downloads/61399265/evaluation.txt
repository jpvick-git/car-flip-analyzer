This vehicle may not be the best flip candidate due to the extensive front-end damage that includes structural and airbag issues. Repairs will be costly and time-consuming, and the resale value might not justify the investment. It could be a viable option if parts can be sourced cheaply and labor costs are minimal; otherwise, it is a high-risk investment.
