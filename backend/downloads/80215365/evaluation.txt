This vehicle could be a reasonable flip candidate if acquired at a low cost. Despite the significant front-end damage, the engine bay looks intact, and the interior is in good condition, indicating limited internal damage. The repair costs are moderate, and if the vehicle has solid resale potential, it could offer a decent profit margin.
