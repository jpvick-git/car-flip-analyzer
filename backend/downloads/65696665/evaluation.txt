This vehicle may not be the best candidate for flipping due to the extent of visible damage, which could entail high repair costs. If acquired at a low purchase price, it might still offer a moderate profit margin post-repair. The engine and interior appear to be in acceptable condition, potentially enhancing resale appeal.
