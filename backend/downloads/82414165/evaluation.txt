This vehicle appears to be a fair candidate for a profitable flip if the purchase price is low. The main visible issue is the missing front end, which can be a moderately complex repair. Given the condition of the body and interior, with proper repairs and detailing, it has good resale potential, assuming there are no major mechanical issues.
