This car appears to require extensive repairs to the front end, which could be complex and costly. Considering the visible damage, the car might not offer a substantial resale margin unless acquired at a very low purchase price. It would not be a preferred candidate for a flip unless sourced cheaply and all repairs can be ensured to be economically feasible.
