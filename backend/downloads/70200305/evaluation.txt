This vehicle presents a high-risk investment for flipping due to the extensive visible damage to the front end and potential hidden mechanical issues. While the interior is in fair condition, the repair complexity and costs might outweigh the resale value unless the initial purchase price is very low. Not ideal for a quick or budget flip.
