This vehicle seems like a good candidate for flipping given the generally good condition of its interior and engine bay. As long as the cost of repairing the visible damage is within budget, the vehicle can be sold at a profit. Ensuring a thorough mechanical check could uncover any hidden issues, but based on visuals, it appears to have good resale potential.
