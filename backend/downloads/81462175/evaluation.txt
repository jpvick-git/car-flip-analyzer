This vehicle may be a reasonable candidate for flipping due to its limited visible damage, primarily focused on front-end repair. However, ensure the frame and alignment are not compromised. If purchased at a low price, with repairs focusing on cosmetic and minor structural fixes, it could yield a moderate profit.
