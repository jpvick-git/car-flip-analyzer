This vehicle could be a decent flip candidate if purchased at a low price. While there are visible exterior damages that may discourage some buyers, they are relatively straightforward to repair. Assuming no major mechanical issues are found upon deeper inspection, the market for this model should support a profitable resale after repairs.
