This vehicle could be a viable candidate for flipping if acquired at a low purchase price. The most significant concern is the deployed airbags, which could be costly to repair. The overall exterior and engine condition suggest that, with minor investments and repairs, the vehicle can achieve a decent resale value. Consideration of the resale market demand for this model is advisable before purchase.
