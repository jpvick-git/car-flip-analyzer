This vehicle seems like a reasonable candidate for flipping due to its good exterior and interior condition, aside from a flat tire. Repair costs should be moderate if no major mechanical issues are present. If purchased at a low enough initial price, it has good resale potential, especially if any hidden issues are minor.
