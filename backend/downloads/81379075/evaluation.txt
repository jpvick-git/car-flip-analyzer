This vehicle may not be the best candidate for flipping due to extensive front-end damage and potential hidden mechanical issues. If the repair costs are kept within the estimate, it might turn a small profit, but the risk is higher compared to other potential flips. Resale potential is moderate, assuming a clean title and successful repairs.
