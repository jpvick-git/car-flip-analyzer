The vehicle appears to have significant front-end damage, missing a bumper, grille, and headlights. Interior looks intact and clean. Parts visibly lying next to the car suggest some disassembly. Repairs will likely involve purchasing and installing a new front bumper, grille, headlights, fender flares, and potentially addressing any unseen mechanical damage related to the front impact.
