This vehicle presents a high-risk flipping candidate given the extensive front-end damage and potential hidden issues in the engine and suspension. The cost of repairs might outweigh potential profits unless parts and labor can be sourced at a low cost. Proceed with caution, especially if the goal is a quick resale.
