The visible damage includes a front end collision resulting in a missing front bumper, damage to the front left fender, and a bent front wheel. Repairs needed are replacement of the front bumper and left fender, wheel alignment, and potentially suspension checks. The interior appears intact, but cleaning and minor fixes may be needed.
